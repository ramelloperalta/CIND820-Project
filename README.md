COVID-19 has swept the world and impacted almost all aspects of daily life. From weakening public health, depressed economies, to the upending of our social customs--the damage of COVID-19 has inflicted a devastating, long-term toll on society. In the aftermath, the effects of a pandemic of this scale require drastic restructuring of many of our systems. It is therefore imperative to critically review the data from such an event to inform of the facts, and chiefly to develop proper strategies for mitigation of future pandemics. In this project I hope to analyse what properties of a country’s population made it more susceptible to the virus. The primary theme will be predictive analytics to develop a feature profile for a “well-performing” country in transmission mitigation. Secondarily, data mining techniques will be employed to discover underlying patterns in the data that may bring more important information to light. In this project I will be using the Our World in Data’s COVID-19 Dataset, an aggregate dataset from international government sources. The goals of this project are two-fold: To understand which key features affect COVID19 outcomes, and the second to develop a forecasting model to model the next 30 days of the pandemic. These techniques will enable me to derive insight from the data to better understand this pandemic and by extension others that may arise.

This project consists of visualizations using plotly and plotly express libraries, Data mining using RF, and finally ARIMA modeling with statsmodels.
