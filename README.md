COVID-19 has swept the world and impacted almost all aspects of daily life. From weakening public health, depressed economies, to the upending of our social customs--the damage of COVID-19 has inflicted a devastating, long-term toll on society. In the aftermath, the effects of a pandemic of this scale require drastic restructuring of many of our systems. It is therefore imperative to critically review the data from such an event to inform of the facts, and chiefly to develop proper strategies for mitigation of future pandemics. In this project I hope to analyse what properties of a country’s population made it more susceptible to the virus. The primary theme will be predictive analytics to develop a feature profile for a “well-performing” country in transmission mitigation. Secondarily, data mining techniques will be employed to discover underlying patterns in the data that may bring more important information to light. In this project I will be using the Our World in Data’s COVID-19 Dataset, an aggregate dataset from international government sources. Some features include, but are not limited to: GDP-per-capita, geoclimate info, population ages, population density, handwashing facilities, diabetes prevalence and HDI. Some techniques I will utilize are: random forest algorithms, multiple regression methods (stepwise, kNN) and k-means clustering. These techniques will enable me to derive valuable, actionable insight from the data to inform of the best possible mitigation strategies for the next pandemic that arises.
